# Pewter

**Pewter** is an open-source project for
        1. Data acquisition
        2. Analysis
        3. Visualisation
of raw data from Myo and conduct experiments on it. If you are working on raw data from the Myo Armband, then you can make use of **Pewter's** simple GUI to acquire data and work on it. It not only reduces devlopement time but also makes the life of a machine learning engineer easier. You can create experiments and visualise the data for doing some analysis before preprocessing and feature extraction. All the experiment data will be saved in Json format which makes it even convenient for reuse.

**Pewter** was originally developed by me for data acquisition and analysis of raw data from Myo Armband for one of my projects [Voice](https://github.com/sigvoiced/Voice).

I would be glad if you could contribute in this initiative of mine to help other developers working on Myo Armbands and making their lives easier.
